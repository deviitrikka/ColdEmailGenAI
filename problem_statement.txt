problem statement :
there are software service companies like tcs infosys stc having huge staff of sw engineers
these companies help their clients(nike jpmorgan kroger) by providing their staff 
sales team from infosys tcs etc strategically applying their marketing strategies would send a cold email to the potential clients (nike adidas etc)

now how wd the sales team know if they have a requirements? one of the method wd be they would go to their job portal, look into all the skills they need for a particular role(say aiml developer) and hence send a cold email to the clients
so instead of hiring full time, they can hire people from tcs infosys etc on a contract basis escaping the huge costs of hiring full time and other benefits
